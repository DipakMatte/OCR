## OCR Tutorial

This tutorial explains the Optical Character Recognition (OCR) demo and shows you how to deploy it to the Nimbella Cloud.

The OCR application displays a web page where visitors select a language (English, Spanish, or Chinese) and then drag a JPG, GIF, or PNG image onto the page, where it is automatically converted to text. If the conversion is successful, users can read the text and click a **Speak** button to hear the text. You can [try out the application here](https://ocrdemo-apigcp.nimbella.io).
